## 1.Set Matrix Zeroes

**Problem:** Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place.

### Example:

Input:
[
[1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 1],
[1, 1, 1]
]

Output:
[
[1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 1]
]

## 2.Pascal's Triangle

**Problem:** Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of integers constructed with the following pattern:

- Each row starts and ends with 1.
- Each subsequent row is generated by summing up the two adjacent numbers in the previous row.

### Example:

Input: `numRows = 5`

Output:
[
[1],
[1,1],
[1,2,1],
[1,3,3,1],
[1,4,6,4,1]
]
